# Project: Fâš½âš½TBALL: EXPECTED GOALS (xG) PAYER REVIEW (SEASON 2022/23) 

### Project Description

Taking data from FBref, measure relevant players's chance conversion from the top five leagues, comparing their output of Expected Goals (xG) vs Goals Scored.

"In the domain of performance analysis in soccer, analyst and research teams support staff members with information primarily to enable understanding of performance, and to improve training regimes and decision-making. More specifically, many high-level soccer teams employ key performance indicators (KPIs) regularly to measure and increase tactical performance. KPIs are quantifiable measures used to evaluate the success of an organization, team, employee, or athlete, in meeting objectives for performance." 

**ðŸŽ¯ Goal:** Plot the performance of all attacking players from the world's top five football leagues in 2022/23, highlighting those who have over- and under-performed.  

## Project Challenges

### <ins>EDA</ins>

- Create consistent naming practices for the columns across all datasets.
- Clean the data and ensure that there are no duplicate orders or missing values.
- Convert columns to theappropriate data types.
- Remove any non-attacking players and players which would be considered to have a small sample size.

### <ins>KPIs</ins>

- Identify the high chance converters from each league.
- Identify the low chance converters from each league.
- Identify the high-profile players and assess their performances.


### <ins>Visualise the Data</ins>

- Plot the performance of all players, making it easy to see where players have over- / under-performed their xG.
- Annotate the players previously identified.
