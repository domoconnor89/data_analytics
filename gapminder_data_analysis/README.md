# Project: GAPMINDER ANALYSIS

### Project Description

Explain global development and global issues through animated visualisations using data supplied by The Gapminder Foundation.

**ðŸŽ¯ Goal:** Create animated plots for Gloabl Life Expectancy Trends

- Rename columns
- Drop all observations with missing data

- Repeat for the the life_expectancy, and fertility_rate

### Descriptive Statistics

- Visually describe the data through a variety of metrics.

### Merge, Aggregate, and Group the data
