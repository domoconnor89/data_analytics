# Project: Comparative Analysis; Long vs. Short Goal Kicks in the WSL.

### Project Description

The belief that more and more football teams tend to play short from their goal-kicks certainly passes the eye test. The benefit in doing so is less apparent among some spectators and pundits who often question the approach, ridiculing it as an unneccessary risk.
Breaking down [StatsBomb's Match Event Data](https://statsbomb.com/news/statsbomb-release-free-2020-21-fa-womens-super-league-data-updated-r-guide/) for the Women's Super League (seasons 2018/19 - 2020/21), I have assessed football's the trend towards shorter goalkick's, the numbers which evidence a risk & reward to this approach, and an overview of each team's build-up from goal-kicks.

**ðŸŽ¯ Goal:** Explore the numbers to surmise whether the risk is worth the reward for teams opting play short from goal-kicks.

## Project Challenges

### <ins>EDA</ins>
- As described by StatsBomb, their Match Event Data records over 3,400 events per match, with twenty potential descriptors for each of those events.
- Get to know the data and gain a certain amount of familiarity with it before starting to extract insights from it.

### <ins>DATA WRANGLING, EXPLORATION and CLEANSING </ins>
- Disect the data from every match across three seasons
- Clean and account for missing data
- Filter to the phases of play within each match relevant to goalkicks and the opposition's subsequent actions
- Merge, Aggregate, and Group the data

### <ins>Analyze Data</ins>
- Analyze the data with descriptive statistics (avg. Goals, Shots, Territory, etc. both Gained and Conceded)
- Extract new features from the data and investigate the trends, patterns, and relationships within it
- Is there a consistent link between league position and play style across each season?

### <ins>Data Visualisation</ins>
- Visually describe the data through a variety of metrics

### <ins>Create Team Dashboards</ins>
- In Tableau, allow users to view the stats of each team for each of the seasons
- Each team should have their statistical performance ranked in comparison to the other competing teams in that season.
- Visually represent the team's general build-up play following both short and long goal-kicks.
