# Project: Business Analyst Projects & Operations

### Project Description

You are a Business Analyst in the Projects & Operations Team at an e-commerce company,_Smartbuy_. You have visited a Training session by the Content Department, responsible for managing the categories, during which they explain the process of how they manually identify the seasonality of a category. 

The word _‘manually’_ makes you curious and you quickly realize that there must be a more effective way to identify different seasonality patterns. 

You reach out in support of the content team who give you a list of csv-files which contain the ***pageviews*** of a given category in a specific month.

## Tasks

Create an analysis to help the content team and answer following questions:

- Is there a seasonal pattern for all categories?
- What are common patterns that we observe within the categories?
- Are there categories with a similar fingerprint?
- Now that you know the seasonal pattern, what next actions would you recommend for the company?
- Create a presentation to show what you did. Make your results accessible for a broad audience so that they can use it.
