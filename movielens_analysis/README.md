# Project: MovieLens SQL Project

## Project Description

Explore historical movie data and user ratings with SQL to analyze a dataset of movies and ratings, with a focus on understanding the data structure, exploring movie genres, and identifying popular movies.

**ðŸŽ¯ Goal:** 

- Import a dataset into a cloud-based database.
- Solve SQL challenges to explore and analyze the movie data.
- Report findings to the Oscars board of governors.

## Define Questions

- Questions include exploring data structure, movie genres, release years, and popularity metrics.

## Identify Data Sources

- Set up a Google Cloud account.
- Retrieve movie data from the MovieLens database.
- Create a PostgreSQL database in the cloud.

## Retrieve Data

- Ingest data into the database using SQL.
- Extract data from the database using SQL.

## Data Wrangling, Exploration, and Cleaning

- Solve one-liner challenges to answer various questions.
- Create table definitions with SQL.

## Analyze Data

- Perform exploratory data analysis using SQL.
- Explore genres, release years, and popularity metrics.


## Solve with SQL

### Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA) Questions:

- Explore the data structure and display the movies table.
- Display movie titles and genres of the first 10 entries sorted alphabetically.
- Determine the total count of movies in the dataset.
- Explore movies with the "Drama" genre and count pure Drama movies.
- Check movies that have Drama as one of the assigned genres.
- Compare Drama movies with other genres.
- Analyze the distribution of movie release years.
- Find movies from the year 2003.
- Retrieve Star Wars movies.

### Further Analysis with Joins:

- Find movies with the lowest IMDb IDs.
- Modify the query to count Drama movies.
- Discover movies with the tag "fun"
- Find the first movie without any tags.
- Identify the most liked genres based on average ratings.
- Find movies watched by the largest group of people.
- Compare your favorite Star Wars movie with dataset ratings.
- Save results in a derived table.

### Bonus:

- Find top genres in 2 different era and top rated movies in each genre
- Use insights to advocate for specific movies.

## Files and Scripts

- `movielens_eda.sql`: SQL queries for initial data analysis.
- `movielens_groupby.sql`: SQL queries for groupby analysis.
- `movielens_joins.sql`: SQL queries using joins for comprehensive analysis.

## Conclusion

This project aims to leverage SQL to explore and analyze movie data.
For detailed implementation of each part of the project, refer to the respective SQL script files.

**Note:** The data and SQL scripts used in this project may vary based on the actual dataset and database setup.
